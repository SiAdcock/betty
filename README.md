# Betty

A history in three acts

# Act 1: Caravan

- For several years, Betty and Tom owned a caravan at a park in Wyre Piddle (?)
- And for what seemed like every weekend of those years, my sister Sarah and I would bundle into Tom's Ford Granada and we'd all head out to the caravan for a weekend on the River Avon
- When we arrived, Tom would go off fishing, catching at best a few tiddlers. Betty would work on her garden. Sarah and I would seek out our weekend friends and play football or hide and seek late into the evening
- At some point we'd head out to nearby Pershore for a few hours in the local swimming baths.
- Betty would heroically guide us through fields of cows and horses in a way that defied her age.
- But my favourite moments were waking up on Sunday morning to a cup of tea and a saucer of Malted Milk biscuits. Betty knew we adored it and she always kept an abundant supply.
