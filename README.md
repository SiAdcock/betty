# Betty

# Caravan

- For several years, Betty and Tom owned a caravan at a park in Wyre Piddle in the Worcestershire countryside.
- And for what seemed like every weekend of those years, my sister Sarah and I would bundle into Tom's Ford Granada and we'd all head out to the caravan for a weekend on the River Avon
- When we arrived, Tom would go off fishing, catching at best a few tiddlers. Betty would work on her garden. Sarah and I would seek out our weekend friends and play football or hide and seek late into the evening
- At some point we'd head out to nearby Pershore for a few hours in the local swimming baths.
- Betty would heroically guide us through fields of cows and horses in a way that defied her age.
- But my favourite moments were waking up on Sunday morning to a cup of tea and a saucer of Malted Milk biscuits. Betty knew we adored it and she always kept an abundant supply.

# Letters

- When I was 18 I went to university in Southampton
- It was the first time I had been a long way from home. Auntie Betty was my pen pal.
- I would collect my letters from reception in my halls of residence. 
- Once a month, there would be a letter with the exquisite cursive handwriting that nobody seems to have time for these days.
- Betty would send word of all the Birmingham gossip, often with clippings from the Evening Mail.
- She'd warn me of disease outbreaks at university halls, scams targetting students. Inclement weather, murderers on the loose.
- Her letters were distinctive, much like the instructions she left for this funeral. 
- The handwriting. Short sentences. Strong verbs. 
- "Wrap up warm."
- "Watch out for seagulls." To this day, I have no idea what she had against seagulls, but I assured her that of course, I would.
- She'd underline important words several times. Some words would be wrapped in quotation marks. 
- And sometimes she'd draw little doodles for emphasis: sad faces, birds and rain clouds. She pre-empted the emoji by about 15 years.
