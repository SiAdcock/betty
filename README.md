# Betty

- I'd like to start by saying thank you to each and every one of you for coming today. 
- It would mean so much to Betty to see how many people she had touched over the years.
- I want to talk about two periods of my life in which Betty meant a lot to me. Little things maybe not everyone knows about.
- I think they demonstrate what a big heart she had, how much she cared

# Caravan

- For several years, Betty and Tom owned a caravan at a park in Wyre Piddle in the Worcestershire countryside.
- And for what seemed like every weekend of those years, my sister Sarah and I would bundle into Tom's Ford Granada and we'd all head out to the caravan for a weekend on the River Avon
- When we arrived, Tom would go off fishing, catching at best a few tiddlers. 
- Betty would work on the garden surrounding her caravan. 
- Sarah and I would seek out our weekend friends and play football or hide and seek late into the evening
- We'd often walk to nearby Pershore for a few hours in the local swimming baths.
- Betty would heroically guide us across fields of cows and horses in a way that defied her age.
- But my favourite moments were waking up on Sunday morning to pot-brewed tea served in a china cup,with a saucer of malted milk biscuits. 
- Betty knew we adored this ritual and she always kept an abundant supply of those biscuits.
- I still get a fuzzy feeling in my stomach every time I dunk a malted milk into a cup of tea.

# Letters

- When I was 18 I went to university in Southampton
- It was the first time I had been a long way from home. Auntie Betty was my pen pal.
- I would collect my letters from reception in my halls of residence. 
- Once a month, there would be a letter with the exquisite cursive handwriting that nobody seems to have time for these days.
- Betty would send word of all the Birmingham gossip, often with clippings from the Evening Mail.
- She'd warn me of disease outbreaks at university halls, scams targetting students. Inclement weather, murderers on the loose.
- Her letters were distinctive, much like the instructions she left for this funeral. 
- The handwriting. Short sentences. Strong verbs. 
- "Wrap up warm."
- "Watch out for seagulls." To this day, I have no idea what she had against seagulls, but I assured her that of course, I'd be careful.
- She'd underline important words several times. Some words would be wrapped in quotation marks. 
- And sometimes she'd draw little doodles for emphasis: sad faces, birds and rain clouds. She pre-empted the emoji by about 15 years.
- No matter how I felt, whether lonely, sad or scared, Betty's letters were a friendly reminder of home, that people loved me.
- She knew I appreciated them, so she kept sending them, like malted milk biscuits on a Sunday morning
- Let's promise to keep Betty in our thoughts, our prayers, so she knows we're always thinking of her
